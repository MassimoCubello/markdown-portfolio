## Massimo Cubello's Portfolio

### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Massimo!

Iâ€™m a web developer with a background in marketing and customer success. My journey into tech grew from years of helping people, solving problems, and telling stories that connect people. Now, Iâ€™m bringing those skills into development by building web experiences that are not only functional but also engaging, user-friendly, and human-centred.

#### ðŸ’» My approach as a developer is shaped by my past

From **marketing**, I bring an understanding of unique audiences, captivating storytelling, and creating experiences that resonate.

From **customer success**, I bring empathy, listening skills, and a drive to solve real problems for real people.

I believe the best products sit at the intersection of technology, usability, and communication. Whether Iâ€™m coding a front-end interface or collaborating with a team, I aim to create solutions that work and connect.

### Projects

#### GitHub Repositories

As a complete beginner to coding, I haven't worked on any projects in the past that have involved the need for code, as much of my work over the last ten years has been in content strategy and customer success.

However, I do have a list of [my current repositories](/projects.markdown) here.
